# Visual SLAM-based Indoor Navigation using Python

This project demonstrates a simple Visual SLAM system using Python and OpenCV. It tracks camera motion in real-time using ORB features and plots the camera trajectory.

## Features
- ORB feature detection and matching
- Essential Matrix-based motion estimation
- Real-time camera trajectory plotting
- Webcam or video file input

## Run Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
